As your bright and tiny spark 	1
For you never shut your eye, 	1
How I wonder what you are! 	1
How could he see where to go, 	1
If you did not twinkle so? 	1
In the dark blue sky you keep, 	1
Lights the traveler in the dark, 	1
Like a diamond in the sky. 	1
Often through my curtains peep 	1
Thanks you for your tiny spark, 	1
Then the traveler in the dark 	1
Then you show your little light, 	1
Though I know not what you are, 	1
Till the sun is in the sky. 	1
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. 	1
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 	1
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.	1
Up above the world so high, 	1
When he nothing shines upon, 	1
When the blazing sun is gone, 	1
